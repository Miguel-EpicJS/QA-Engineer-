# Fundamentals of QA Engineering

## QA Cycle

PDCA:
 - Plan -- Establish the process related objectives and determine the processes that are required to deliver a high Quality end procuct.
 - Do -- Development and testing of processes and also "do" changes in the processes.
 - Check -- Monitoring of processes
 - Act -- A QA tester should implement actions that are necessary to achieve improvements in the processes.

QA is used to ensure that the product is designed and implemented with correct procedures.

Quality Control vs Quality Assurance

QC is about the result, and QA is about the processes.
QC is reactive, and QA is proactive.
QC is line function, and QA has staff function.
QC is to find defects, QA is to prevent defects.

## Testing approaches

Functional testing: is a process of verifying that a system performs as expected when its features are exercised by another system or directly by a user.

 - Unit tests.
 - Integration tests.
 - Sanity checks.
 - Regression tests.
 - Usability acceptance.

 - Black box: the contents of the code is unknown.
 - White box: the code is known.
 - Gray box: a mix of white and black testing.

Methods

 - TDD ( Test Driven Development)
 - ATDD ( Acceptance Test Driven Development)
 - BDD ( Behavior Driven Development)
